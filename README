# Tyson's coding adventure

Code example and exercises to start from the ground up.

## Organization

Each set of skills will be contained in a directory.

For example, basic math, variables, user input will be contained in a dir similarly named like `01-math_vars_input`

All exercises will in Python for the time being.
We will expand to additional languages as needed in the future.
